1. in a program , input 3 numbers : A , B and C . you have to output the average
 of these 3 numbers.

 Ans : 

   System.out.println("Enter 3 numbers :");
    
    int a = inp.nextInt();
    int b = inp.nextInt();
    int c = inp.nextInt();

    int Average = (a+b+c)/3;
    
    System.out.println("Average of 3 Numbers is : " +Average);


2. in a program , input the side of a Square. you have to output the area of the Square.

Ans : 

    int side = inp.nextInt();

    int Square = (side * side);    

    System.out.println("Square of Side = " + Square);

3. Enter cost of 3 items from the user (using float data type) - a pencil , pen and 
    eraser . you have to output the total cost of the items back to the user as their bill.    
    (Add on : you can also try adding 18% of Gst tax to the items in the bill as an 
    advanced  problem ).

Ans : 

float pencil = inp.nextFloat();
    float pen = inp.nextFloat();
    float eraser = inp.nextFloat();

    float total_cost =  pencil + pen + eraser;


    float gst_cost = (total_cost * 0.18f);

    float total_bill = total_cost + gst_cost;

    System.out.println(total_cost);

    System.out.println(total_bill);


4.  What will be the type of result in the following java code : 

   byte b = 4 ;
   char c = 'a';
   short s = 512;
   int i = 1000;
   float f = 3.14f;
   double d = 99.9954;

   result = (f*b) + (i % c) - (d * s);

 Ans : 
      double is the largest value of result.

      double  result = (f*b) + (i % c) - (d * s);


5. will the following statement give any error in java ? 

    int $ = 24;

Ans : it is valid.
      it not give any error in java . beacause it is special
      symbol & identifier and not a reserve word.
